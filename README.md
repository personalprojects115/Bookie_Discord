# My personal bot for my discord

## Author: Marina De Pazzi

Hello! here you will find the source code for my personal bot, Bookie. I created this bot for fun and personal practice on JavaScript, thus it is very likely you will not find coding masterpieces or anything extraordinary about it. 

Moreover, although I tried to keep best practices on this project, maybe I missed one or two. If you are eager to contribute: please, leave a message or an issue mark (I am not entirely sure how git works for code improvement and suggestions).
