Lesson 1 -> When using includes function of an array, if you want to check for the existence of a message within the array DO NOT do the following: 

array.includes(message);

Why? it will check if the OBJECT message exists within the array. Instead, do the following:

array.includes(message.content);

=====================================================

Lesson 2 -> SyntaxError: Invalid shorthand property initializer

When this exception is thrown it means that a wrong symbol was used when initalizing a flemis was used.
Ex: 
module.exports = {
    name: 'flemis'
    description = '...'
                â†‘
    instead of a "=", it should be used a ":"
}
